Day 6 of #100DaysOfDataEngineering

I took off two days for the weekend -- it was a long week. Got back on the horse today while covering normalization and denormalization with @Seattle Data Guy's video[1] on data modelling. Haven't thought of 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal form since my college database course! Still, this was all "well duh" territory after so much Ruby on Rails development.
