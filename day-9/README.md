Day 9 of #100DaysOfDataEngineering

Starting to read through Data Warehousing Techniques by Ralph Kimball, which apparently is the data engineering bible. Part way through chapter 1. I'm planning on a quick read through of the first three chapters before moving on to more concrete practice.

It really stands out how much of this ends up focused on the business side/users, rather than technology. Kimball isn't subtle about it, but he never refers to a "data warehouse", always preferring a "data warehouse/business intelligence system". My mom always used to say that it didn't matter how smart you were if you couldn't communicate. This focus feels very similar
