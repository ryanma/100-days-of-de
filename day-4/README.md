Day 4 of #100DaysOfDataEngineering

Found a sweet new tool today. Rainfrog [1], a terminal UI for editing and managing SQL queries. The vim-emulation is less than perfect, but all this functionality without taking my hands off the keyboard is fantastic. Contributing to this would be fun, but I'm learning enough new languages at the moment -- I don't need to learn Rust too

Not much to report -- still working through intermediate SQL concepts. Halfway through @techTFQ's YouTube video[2] on practicing complex SQL queries. I'll finish the other 5 tomorrow. SQL window functions were new to me, but those are really useful.
