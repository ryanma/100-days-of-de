Day 3 of #100DaysOfDataEngineering

At the suggestion of Martina Desender, I worked through https://mystery.knightlab.com as a SQL refresher. That was a refreshing, fun little challenge.

Common Table Expressions were brand new to me, but definitely useful. Took a moment to get the hang of them -- The need to alias the CTE name was throwing me off at first.

Nailed the last query with a composite query, and the rest of it just needed some strategic joins, subqueries and CTEs!
