Day 7 of #100DaysOfDataEngineering

First day really dedicated to textbook learning/work. Reading through the data modelling chapter in Joe Reis' Fundamentals of Data Engineering. Today's reading was some more normalization/denormalization reivew, then high-level descriptions of the Inmon and Kimball approaches. Tomorrow I'll finish up the chapter: Data Vault and modelling of streaming data
