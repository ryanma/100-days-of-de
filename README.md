# 100 Days of Data Engineering

I'm upskilling as part of a job search, and this is part of it. Majorly inspired by [Seattle Data Guy's 100 days of data engineering](https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/growing-from-analyst-to-data-engineer) substack post.

I'm shooting to include basically a commit each day to this repository, which will include the work and practice I'm doing for that day. Sometimes my commit will just be a couple notes about what I did for the day.
