# Metalearning Plan

Here's my plan for topics to learn thoughout my 100 Days of DE. Subject to revision as we move forward throughout all of this process. Roughly following through with chapter 4 in _Ultralearning_ by Scott Young

## Why:

  - Learn some new useful tools
  - Find a new job in data engineer -- close enough to software engineering to be useful but farther away from JavaScript churn
  - DE will have plenty of demand going forward
  - Prove to myself that I can do "something hard"
  - Get back into the habit of learning

## What:

### Concepts

Anything that needs to be understood

- Textbook topics (Fundamentals of Data Engineering, Data Warehousing Techniques)
  - Generation
  - Ingestion
  - Storage
  - Transformation
  - Serving
- SQL under the hood
- ETL/ELT
- Distributed compute concepts
- write-audit-publish patterns

### Facts

Anything that needs to be memorized

- SQL syntax
- Python
- Bash commands/syntax

### Procedures

Anything that needs to be practiced

- Python
- SQL
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- "Devops" of data engineering, i.e. IaC and cloud tools

## How

How do you know that this is a good list of things to be studying?

### Benchmark method

- Compare to publicly available curricula and study guides
- Take a certification exam at the end?
  - Does this imply limiting myself to one set of vendor tools (i.e. AWS, Azure, Databricks)

### Emphasize/Exclude

- Emphasize:
  - Practical knowledge and practice of using popular tools
- Exclude:
  - heavy learning about most tools that I'm not actively using. Overviews/concepts about them are _probably_ still useful
