Day 8 of #100DaysOfDataEngineering

Finished reading through the section on modelling data, and the high-level description of the Data Vault approach.

After going through that section, I'm nearly certain that Trello uses some kind of Data Vault system in the background. I recently transitioned several Trello boards to Github issues, and used JSON exports of the Trello boards. I found them exceedingly annoying at the time, but it makes a lot more sense in this context.
